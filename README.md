# Informatics ResearchLabs Hackathon

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook submitted for the Informatics ResearchLabs Hackathon. The notebook performs data analysis on a food-ordering dataset, including:

- Merging datasets (`orders.csv`, `users.json`, `restaurants.csv`)
- Cleaning and transforming data
- Calculating metrics such as:
  - Total orders by membership type
  - Revenue by city
  - Average order value
  - Orders by restaurant rating
- Generating insights for Gold members and top cities

## Dataset
- `orders.csv` – Contains order-level details such as `order_id`, `user_id`, `restaurant_id`, `total_amount`, `order_date`.  
- `users.json` – Contains user-level details including `membership_type` and `user_city`.  
- `restaurants.csv` – Contains restaurant information including `restaurant_id`, `cuisine`, and `rating`.
